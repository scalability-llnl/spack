# flake8 settings for Spack.
#
# Below we describe which flake8 checks Spack ignores and what the
# rationale is.
#
# Let people line things up nicely:
# - E221: multiple spaces before operator
# - E241: multiple spaces after ‘,’
#
# Spack allows wildcard imports:
# - F403: disable wildcard import
#
# These are required to get the package.py files to test clean.
# - F821: undefined name (needed for cmake, configure, etc.)
# - F999: name name be undefined or undefined from star imports.
