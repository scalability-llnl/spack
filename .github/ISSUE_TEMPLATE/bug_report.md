about: Report a bug in the core of Spack (command not working as expected, etc.)

*Summarize in a couple of lines the bug you encountered. Ideally it 
should be enough to give core developers an idea what might be happening 
in the code. Try your best to be clear and concise.* :wink:

### Steps to reproduce the issue

```console
$ spack <command1> <spec>
$ spack <command2> <spec>
...
```

### Expected Result

What you expected before running the command or performing the steps 
described above.

### Actual Result

What happened instead


### Information on your system

This includes:

 1. which platform you are using
 2. any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.)

-----

We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!

If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.

Other than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!
