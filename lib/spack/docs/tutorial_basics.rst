Basic Installation Tutorial
=========================================

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing software
using Spack. We will first cover the `spack install` command, focusing on
the power of the spec syntax and the flexibility it gives to users. We
will also cover the `spack find` command for viewing installed packages
and the `spack uninstall` command. Finally, we will touch on how Spack
manages compilers, especially as it relates to using Spack-built
compilers within Spack. We will include full output from all of the
commands demonstrated, although we will frequently call attention to only
small portions of that output (or merely to the fact that it
succeeded). The provided output is all from a cluster running Red Hat
Enterprise Linux.

----------------
Installing Spack
----------------

Spack works out of the box. Simply clone spack and get going.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/LLNL/spack.git
  Initialized empty Git repository in ~/spack/.git/
  remote: Counting objects: 47125, done.
  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (68/68), done.
  remote: Total 47125 (delta 16), reused 2 (delta 2), pack-reused 47047
  Receiving objects: 100% (47125/47125), 12.02 MiB | 2.11 MiB/s, done.
  Resolving deltas: 100% (23044/23044), done.
  $ cd spack

Then add Spack to your path.

.. code-block:: console

  $ export PATH=~/spack/bin:$PATH

You're good to go!

-----------------
What is in Spack?
-----------------

The ``spack list`` command shows available packages.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack list
  ==> 1016 packages.
  abinit                           hwloc                  piranha              r-rjava
  ack                              hydra                  pixman               r-rjson
  activeharmony                    hypre                  pkg-config           r-rjsonio
  ...

The ``spack list`` command can also take a query string. Spack
automatically adds wildcards to both ends of the string. For example,
we can view all available python packages.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack list py
  ==> 129 packages.
  py-3to2            py-epydoc          py-nestle         py-pycparser         py-six
  py-alabaster       py-flake8          py-netcdf         py-pydatalog         py-sncosmo
  py-argcomplete     py-funcsigs        py-networkx       py-pyelftools        py-snowballstemmer
  ...

-------------------
Installing Packages
-------------------

Installing a package with Spack is very simple. To install a piece of
software, simply type ``spack install <package_name>``

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack install libelf

Spack's spec syntax is the interface by which we can request specific
configurations of the package. The ``%`` sigil is used to specify
compilers.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack install libelf %intel

Note that this installation is located separately from the previous
one. We will discuss this in more detail later, but this is part of what
allows Spack to support arbitrarily versioned software.

You can check for particular versions before requesting them. We will
use the ``spack versions`` command to see the available versions, and then
install a different version of ``libelf``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack versions libelf
  ==> Safe versions (already checksummed):

compilers.

The spec syntax also includes compiler flags. Spack accepts
``cppflags``, ``cflags``, ``cxxflags``, ``fflags``, ``ldflags``, and
``ldlibs`` parameters.  The values of these fields must be quoted on
the command line if they include spaces. These values are injected
into the compile line automatically by the Spack compiler wrappers.

The ``spack find`` command is used to query installed packages. Note that
some packages appear identical with the default output. The ``-l`` flag
shows the hash of each package, and the ``-f`` flag shows any non-empty
compiler flags of those packages.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find
  ==> 5 installed packages.
  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------

Spack generates a hash for each spec. This hash is a function of the full
provenance of the package, so any change to the spec affects the
hash. Spack uses this value to compare specs and to generate unique
installation directories for every combinatorial version. As we move into
more complicated packages with software dependencies, we can see that
Spack reuses existing packages to satisfy a dependency only when the
existing package's hash matches the desired spec.

Dependencies can be explicitly requested using the ``^`` sigil. Note that
the spec syntax is recursive. Anything we could specify about the
top-level package, we can also specify about a dependency using ``^``.

Packages can also be referred to from the command line by their package
hash. Using the ``spack find -lf`` command earlier we saw that the hash
of our optimized installation of libelf (``cppflags="-O3"``) began with
``vrv2ttb``. We can now explicitly build with that package without typing
the entire spec, by using the ``/`` sigil to refer to it by hash. As with
other tools like git, you do not need to specify an *entire* hash on the
command line.  You can specify just enough digits to identify a hash
uniquely.  If a hash prefix is ambiguous (i.e., two or more installed
packages share the prefix) then spack will report an error.

The ``spack find`` command can also take a ``-d`` flag, which can show
dependency information. Note that each package has a top-level entry,
even if it also appears as a dependency.

As we get to more complex packages, full installs will take too long to
build in the time allotted for this tutorial. Our collaborators at CERN
have been working on binary caching for Spack, which would allow for very
fast installs of previously built packages. We are still working out the
security ramifications of the feature, but it is coming soon.

For now, we will switch to doing "fake" installs. When supplied with the
``--fake`` flag (primarily used for debugging), Spack computes build
metadata the same way it normally would, but it does not download the
source or run the install script for a pacakge. We can use this to
quickly demonstrate some of the more advanced Spack features in our
limited tutorial time.

``HDF5`` is an example of a more complicated package, with an MPI
dependency. If we install it "out of the box," it will build with
``openmpi``.

Spack packages can also have variants. Boolean variants can be specified
using the ``+`` and ``~`` or ``-`` sigils. There are two sigils for
``False`` to avoid conflicts with shell parsing in different
situations. Variants (boolean or otherwise) can also be specified using
the same syntax as compiler flags.  Here we can install HDF5 without MPI
support.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack install --fake hdf5~mpi
  ==> Installing hdf5
  ==> zlib is already installed in ~/spack/opt/spack/linux-redhat6-x86_64/gcc-4.4.7/zlib-1.2.8-ayc4jq7vxuzge5n444gutvskeytfdruh

We might also want to install HDF5 with a different MPI
implementation. While MPI is not a package itself, packages can depend on
abstract interfaces like MPI. Spack handles these through "virtual
dependencies." A package, such as HDF5, can depend on the MPI
interface. Other packages (``openmpi``, ``mpich``, ``mvapich``, etc.)
provide the MPI interface.  Any of these providers can be requested for
an MPI dependency. For example, we can build HDF5 with MPI support
provided by mpich by specifying a dependency on ``mpich``. Spack also
supports versioning of virtual dependencies. A package can depend on the
MPI interface at version 3, and provider packages specify what version of
the interface *they* provide. The partial spec ``^mpi@3`` can be safisfied
by any of several providers.

Spack models the dependencies of packages as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). The ``spack find -d`` command shows the tree representation of
that graph.  We can also use the ``spack graph`` command to view the entire
DAG as a graph.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack graph hdf5+mpi ^mpich
  o  hdf5
  |\
  o |  zlib
   /
  o  mpich

You may also have noticed that there are some packages shown in the
``spack find -d`` output that we didn't install explicitly. These are
dependencies that were installed implicitly. A few packages installed
implicitly are not shown as dependencies in the ``spack find -d``
output. These are build dependencies. For example, ``libpciaccess`` is a
dependency of openmpi and requires ``m4`` to build. Spack will build ``m4`` as
part of the installation of ``openmpi``, but it does not become a part of
the DAG because it is not linked in at run time. Spack handles build
dependencies differently because of their different (less strict)
consistency requirements. It is entirely possible to have two packages
using different versions of a dependency to build, which obviously cannot
be done with linked dependencies.

``HDF5`` is more complicated than our basic example of libelf and
libdwarf, but it's still within the realm of software that an experienced
HPC user could reasonably expect to install given a bit of time. Now
let's look at a more complicated package.

Now we're starting to see the power of Spack. Trilinos has 11 top level
dependecies, many of which have dependencies of their own. Installing
more complex packages can take days or weeks even for an experienced
user. Although we've done a fake installation for the tutorial, a real
installation of trilinos using Spack takes about 3 hours (depending on
the system), but only 20 seconds of programmer time.

Spack manages constistency of the entire DAG. Every MPI dependency will
be satisfied by the same configuration of MPI, etc. If we install
``trilinos`` again specifying a dependency on our previous HDF5 built
with ``mpich``:

As we discussed before, the ``spack find -d`` command shows the
dependency information as a tree. While that is often sufficient, many
complicated packages, including trilinos, have dependencies that
cannot be fully represented as a tree. Again, the ``spack graph``
command shows the full DAG of the dependency information.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack graph trilinos

You can control how the output is displayed with a number of options.

The ASCII output from ``spack graph`` can be difficult to parse for
complicated packages. The output can be changed to the ``graphviz``
``.dot`` format using the ``--dot`` flag.

Uninstalling Packages
---------------------

Earlier we installed many configurations each of libelf and
libdwarf. Now we will go through and uninstall some of those packages
that we didn't really need.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find -d libdwarf
  ==> 3 installed packages.
  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------
      libdwarf@20160507
          ^libelf@0.8.12

      libdwarf@20160507
          ^libelf@0.8.13


  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@16.0.3 --------------------------
      libdwarf@20160507
          ^libelf@0.8.12

  $ spack find libelf
  ==> 6 installed packages.
  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------
  libelf@0.8.12  libelf@0.8.12  libelf@0.8.13

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@15.0.4 --------------------------
  libelf@0.8.13

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@16.0.3 --------------------------
  libelf@0.8.12  libelf@0.8.13


We can uninstall packages by spec using the same syntax as install.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack uninstall libelf%intel@15.0.4
  ==> The following packages will be uninstalled :

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@15.0.4 --------------------------

  ==> Do you want to proceed? [y/n] y
  ==> Successfully uninstalled libelf@0.8.13%intel@15.0.4 arch=linux-redhat6-x86_64-w33hrej

  4blbe3q libelf@0.8.12%intel

  7wgp32x libelf@0.8.13%intel


We can uninstall packages by referring only to their hash.


We can use either ``-f`` (force) or ``-R`` (remove dependents as well) to
remove packages that are required by another installed package.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack uninstall /4blb
  ==> Error: Will not uninstall libelf@0.8.12%intel@16.0.3-4blbe3q

  The following packages depend on it:
  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@16.0.3 --------------------------
  csruprg libdwarf@20160507%intel


  ==> Error: You can use spack uninstall --dependents to uninstall these dependencies as well
  $ spack uninstall -R /4blb
  ==> The following packages will be uninstalled :

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@16.0.3 --------------------------

  ==> Successfully uninstalled libelf@0.8.12%intel@16.0.3 arch=linux-redhat6-x86_64-4blbe3q


Spack will not uninstall packages that are not sufficiently
specified. The ``-a`` (all) flag can be used to uninstall multiple
packages at once.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack uninstall trilinos
  ==> Error: trilinos matches multiple packages:

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------

  ==> Error: You can either:
      a) Use a more specific spec, or
      b) use spack uninstall -a to uninstall ALL matching specs.



  $ spack uninstall /ffwr
  ==> The following packages will be uninstalled :

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------
  ffwrpxn trilinos@12.8.1%gcc+boost~debug+hdf5+hypre+metis+mumps~python+shared+suite-sparse+superlu-dist

-----------------------------
Advanced ``spack find`` Usage
-----------------------------

We will go over some additional uses for the ``spack find`` command not
already covered in the :ref:`basics-tutorial-install` and
:ref:`basics-tutorial-uninstall` sections.

The ``spack find`` command can accept what we call "anonymous specs."
These are expressions in spec syntax that do not contain a package
name. For example, ``spack find %intel`` will return every package built
with the intel compiler, and ``spack find cppflags="-O3"`` will
return every package which was built with ``cppflags="-O3"``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find %intel
  ==> 1 installed packages.
  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / intel@16.0.3 --------------------------
  libelf@0.8.13



  $ spack find cppflags="-O3"
  ==> 1 installed packages.
  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------
  libelf@0.8.12


The ``find`` command can also show which packages were installed
explicitly (rather than pulled in as a dependency) using the ``-e``
flag. The ``-E`` flag shows implicit installs only. The ``find`` command can
also show the path to which a spack package was installed using the ``-p``
command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find -pe
  ==> 10 installed packages.

Customizing Compilers
---------------------


Spack manages a list of available compilers on the system, detected
automatically from from the user's ``PATH`` variable. The ``spack
compilers`` command is an alias for the command ``spack compiler list``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack compilers
  ==> Available compilers
  -- gcc ----------------------------------------------------------
  gcc@4.4.7

  -- intel --------------------------------------------------------

  intel@16.0.2  intel@15.0.0  intel@13.1.1  intel@12.1.2  intel@9.1

  intel@15.0.4  intel@14.0.2  intel@13.0.0  intel@11.1
  intel@15.0.3  intel@14.0.1  intel@12.1.5  intel@10.1

  -- pgi ----------------------------------------------------------
  pgi@16.5-0   pgi@15.7-0   pgi@14.7-0   pgi@13.2-0  pgi@11.10-0  pgi@9.0-4
  pgi@16.3-0   pgi@15.5-0   pgi@14.3-0   pgi@13.1-1  pgi@11.1-0   pgi@8.0-1

  pgi@15.10-0  pgi@14.10-0  pgi@13.6-0   pgi@12.1-0  pgi@10.2-0   pgi@7.0-6

The compilers are maintained in a YAML file that can be hand-edited
for special cases. Spack also has tools to add compilers, and
compilers built with Spack can be added to the configuration.

  -- linux-redhat6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -----------------------------
      gcc@6.1.0  ~/spack/opt/spack/linux-redhat6-x86_64/gcc-4.4.7/gcc-6.1.0-j5576zbsot2ydljlthjzhsirsesnogvh


If we had done a "real" install of gcc, we could add it to our
configuration now using the `spack compiler add` command, but we would
also be waiting for it to install. If we run the command now, it will
return no new compilers.

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack compiler add ~/spack/opt/spack/linux-redhat6-x86_64/gcc-4.4.7/gcc-6.1.0-j5576zbsot2ydljlthjzhsirsesnogvh/bin
  ==> Found no new compilers

If we had done a real install, the output would have been as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack compiler add ~/spack/opt/spack/linux-redhat6-x86_64/gcc-4.4.7/gcc-6.1.0-j5576zbsot2ydljlthjzhsirsesnogvh/bin
  ==> Added 1 new compiler to ~/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml
      gcc@6.1.0
