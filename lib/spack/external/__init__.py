"""This module contains the following external, potentially separately
licensed, packages that are included in Spack:

altgraph
--------

* Homepage: https://altgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* Usage: dependency of macholib
* Version: 0.17.3
* License: MIT

archspec
--------

* Homepage: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/archspec
* Usage: Labeling, comparison and detection of microarchitectures
* Version: 0.2.5-dev (commit 7e6740012b897ae4a950f0bba7e9726b767e921f)
* License: Apache-2.0 or MIT

astunparse
----------------

* Homepage: https://github.com/simonpercivall/astunparse
* Usage: Unparsing Python ASTs for package hashes in Spack
* Version: 1.6.3 (plus modifications)
* License: PSF-2.0
* Note: This is in ``spack.util.unparse`` because it's very heavily
  modified, and we want to track coverage for it.
  Specifically, we have modified this library to generate consistent unparsed ASTs
  regardless of the Python version. It is based on:
    1. The original ``astunparse`` library;
    2. Modifications for consistency;
    3. Backports from the ``ast.unparse`` function in Python 3.9 and later
  The unparsing is now mostly consistent with upstream ``ast.unparse``, so if
  we ever require Python 3.9 or higher, we can drop this external package.
