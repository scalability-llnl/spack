""" Stack spack installations - avoiding double-builds

Stack this spack repository on top of an external read-only spack installation
that already has several packages pre-built.

The installed packages in the remote spack-installation are symlinked into the
directory_layout of the current repository. Hardlinks make little to no sense
since the original files need to remain in place because dependencies are found
via RPATH (which are the old paths in the remote repository).
