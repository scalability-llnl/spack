Functions here are used to take abstract specs and make them concrete.
For example, if a spec asks for a version between 1.8 and 1.9, these
functions might take will take the most recent 1.9 version of the
package available.  Or, if the user didn't specify a compiler for a
spec, then this will assign a compiler to the spec based on defaults
or user preferences.

           or Cray machines.  These constraints will likely come directly
