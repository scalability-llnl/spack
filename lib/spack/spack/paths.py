# The following allows the Paths() class to replace this module in sys.modules:
#
# From Guido van Rossum:
#   (https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2012-May/014969.html)
# There is actually a hack that is occasionally used and recommended: a module
# can define a class with the desired functionality, and then at the end,
# replace itself in sys.modules with an instance of that class (or with the
# class, if you insist, but that's generally less useful). E.g.:
#
#  # module foo.py
#
#    import sys
#
#    class Foo:
#        def funct1(self, <args>): <code>
#        def funct2(self, <args>): <code>
#
#    sys.modules[__name__] = Foo()
#
# This works because the import machinery is actively enabling this hack, and
# as its final step pulls the actual module out of sys.modules, after loading
# it. (This is no accident. The hack was proposed long ago and we decided we
# liked enough to support it in the import machinery.)

# But why? We want user_config_path to be a property so that it can be set from
# a command line option.
