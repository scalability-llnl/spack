class Stage(object):
    """A Stage object manaages a directory where some source code is
       downloaded and built before being installed.  It handles
       fetching the source code, either as an archive to be expanded
       or by checking it out of a repository.  A stage's lifecycle
       looks like this:

       Stage()
         Constructor creates the stage directory.
       fetch()
         Fetch a source archive into the stage.
       expand_archive()
         Expand the source archive.
       <install>
         Build and install the archive.  This is handled by the Package class.
       destroy()
         Remove the stage once the package has been installed.

       If spack.use_tmp_stage is True, spack will attempt to create stages
       in a tmp directory.  Otherwise, stages are created directly in
       spack.stage_path.

       There are two kinds of stages: named and unnamed.  Named stages can
       persist between runs of spack, e.g. if you fetched a tarball but
       didn't finish building it, you won't have to fetch it again.

       Unnamed stages are created using standard mkdtemp mechanisms or
       similar, and are intended to persist for only one run of spack.
