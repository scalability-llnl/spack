    """
    Iterable of specs from the DAG, starting from a list of root specs.

    Arguments:
        specs: List of root specs (considered to be depth 0)
        root: Yield the root nodes themselves
        order: What order of traversal to use in the DAG. For depth-first search this can be
            ``pre`` or ``post``. For BFS this should be ``breadth``.
        cover: Determines how extensively to cover the dag.  Possible values:
            ``nodes`` -- Visit each unique node in the dag only once.
            ``edges`` -- If a node has been visited once but is reached along a new path, it's
            accepted, but not recurisvely followed. This traverses each 'edge' in the DAG once.
            ``paths`` -- Explore every unique path reachable from the root. This descends into
            visited subtrees and will accept nodes multiple times if they're reachable by multiple
            paths.
        direction: ``children`` or ``parents``. If ``children``, does a traversal of this spec's
            children.  If ``parents``, traverses upwards in the DAG towards the root.
        deptype: allowed dependency types
        depth: When ``False``, yield just edges. When ``True`` yield the tuple ``(depth, edge)``,
            where depth corresponds to the depth at which ``edge.spec`` was discovered.
        key: function that takes a spec and outputs a key for uniqueness test.
        visited: a set of nodes not to follow

    Yields:
        By default :class:`~spack.spec.Spec`, or a tuple ``(depth, Spec)`` if depth is
        set to ``True``.

    Generator that yields ``(depth, DependencySpec)`` tuples in the depth-first
