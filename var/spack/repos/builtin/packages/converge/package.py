class Converge(Package):
    """CONVERGE is a revolutionary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program
    that eliminates the grid generation bottleneck from the simulation process.
    CONVERGE was developed by engine simulation experts and is straightforward
    to use for both engine and non-engine simulations. Unlike many CFD
    programs, CONVERGE automatically generates a perfectly orthogonal,
    structured grid at runtime based on simple, user-defined grid control
    parameters. This grid generation method completely eliminates the need to
    manually generate a grid. In addition, CONVERGE offers many other features
    to expedite the setup process and to ensure that your simulations are as
    computationally efficient as possible."""
