class Cuda(Package):
    """CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by
    NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing
    the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

    Note: NVIDIA does not provide a download URL for CUDA so you will need to
    download it yourself. Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
    and select your Operating System, Architecture, Distribution, and Version.
    For the Installer Type, select runfile and click Download. Spack will search
    your current directory for this file. Alternatively, add this file to a
    mirror so that Spack can find it. For instructions on how to set up a mirror,
    see http://software.llnl.gov/spack/mirrors.html

    Note: This package does not currently install the drivers necessary to run
    CUDA. These will need to be installed manually. See:
    http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux for details."""
