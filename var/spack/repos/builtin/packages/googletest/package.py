# FIXME:
# This is a template package file for Spack.  We've conveniently
# put "FIXME" labels next to all the things you'll want to change.
#
# Once you've edited all the FIXME's, delete this whole message,
# save this file, and test out your package like this:
#
#     spack install googletest
#
# You can always get back here to change things with:
#
#     spack edit googletest
#
# See the spack documentation for more information on building
# packages.
