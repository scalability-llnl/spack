    The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing APIs to netlink
    protocol based Linux kernel interfaces.

    Netlink is a IPC mechanism primarly between the kernel and user space
    processes. It was designed to be a more flexible successor to ioctl to
    provide mainly networking related kernel configuration and monitoring
    interfaces.
