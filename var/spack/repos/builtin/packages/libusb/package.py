class Libusb(AutotoolsPackage):
    """libusb is a C library that provides generic access to USB devices. It
    is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the production of
    applications that communicate with USB hardware.

    It is portable: Using a single cross-platform API, it provides access to
    USB devices on Linux, OS X, Windows, Android, OpenBSD, etc.

    It is user-mode: No special privilege or elevation is required for the
    application to communicate with a device.

    It is version-agnostic: All versions of the USB protocol, from 1.0 to 3.1
    (latest), are supported.

    url      = "https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases/download/v1.0.21/libusb-1.0.21.tar.bz2"

    version('1.0.21', '1da9ea3c27b3858fa85c5f4466003e44')
    version('1.0.20', '1d4eb194eaaa2bcfbba28102768c7dbf')

    # NOTE: this package probably works on all Linux, likely OSX
    #       *as-is*.  There are far too many options for me to understand.
    #
    #       The package likely does not work on Windows.  If you need that
    #       refer to WIN_INSTALL on their GitHub page.

    # NOTE: this package *RELIES* on libudev, which requires the systemd PR
    #       to be fixed.  So as it stands, users must ensure that they have
    #       libudev headers and library.  On Fedora, this was available via
    #       dnf install systemd systemd-devel systemd-libs
    #       the apt repos should be similarly named (apt-cache search systemd)
