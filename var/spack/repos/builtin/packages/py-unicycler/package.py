    """Unicycler is an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. It can
    assemble Illumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser.
    It can also assembly long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it
    runs a miniasm+Racon pipeline. For the best possible assemblies, give it
    both Illumina reads and long reads, and it will conduct a hybrid assembly.
