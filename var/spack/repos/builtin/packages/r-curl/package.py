class RCurl(RPackage):
    """The curl() and curl_download() functions provide highly configurable
    drop-in replacements for base url() and download.file() with better
    performance, support for encryption (https, ftps), gzip compression,
    authentication, and other libcurl goodies. The core of the package
    implements a framework for performing fully customized requests where data
    can be processed either in memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback
    or connection interfaces. Some knowledge of libcurl is recommended; for a
    more-user-friendly web client see the 'httr' package which builds on this
    package with http specific tools and logic."""
