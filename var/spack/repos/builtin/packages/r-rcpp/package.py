class RRcpp(Package):
    """The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which
    offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects
    can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both
    writing of new code as well as easier integration of third-party libraries.
    Documentation about 'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in
    this package, via the 'Rcpp Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the
    paper by Eddelbuettel and Francois (2011, JSS), and the book by
    Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer); see 'citation("Rcpp")' for details on these
    last two."""
