class Wx(Package):
    """wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create
       applications for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other platforms
       with a single code base. It has popular language bindings for
       Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages, and unlike other
       cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly
       native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API
       rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free,
       open-source and mature."""
