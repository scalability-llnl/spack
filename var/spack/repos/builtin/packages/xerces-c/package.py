# FIXME:
# This is a template package file for Spack.  We've conveniently

# Once you've edited all the FIXME's, delete this whole message,
# save this file, and test out your package like this:
#
#     spack install xerces-c
#
# You can always get back here to change things with:
#
#     spack edit xerces-c
